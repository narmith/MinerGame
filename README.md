# MinerGame
My first ever game, a clone of Doom (sorta) in which you had to kill some Zombies with a pistol while aboiding turrets shooting on proximity.
Now being transformed in a pseudo Minecraft-Doom.

I have modified it in order to test new and old things.
The Zombie and turrets are gone and no clear objective is set (for now) but the mechanics are still in place.
The enemies will come back, I promise. They are being made from scratch on another proyect of mine (Survival 3D Game) which features bad guys trying to invade your little wood house.

<br>

What you can do:
* Walk around.
* Grab and switch weapons, ammunition and heal ourselves (with whisky).
* Shoot (pistol, bombs) props and watch them go boom or fly around.
* Use a pickaxe (melee) on barrels.
* Heal your life.

What is intended or being reworked:
* Drop weapons.
* Kill enemies and getting scratched in te process.
* Complete the objectives (win over big boss zombies or something) which was done but... no enemies.
* Use the Unity terrain instead of that ugly walls I made.
* MINE with the PickAxe!
* Collect resources for fun.
* Explore and craft your refuge.
** And more after all of the above.
